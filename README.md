# Discord-PTB-AppImage
AppImage builds for [Discord PTB](https://discordapp.com)

To use an AppImage, just download it, `chmod a+x` the AppImage file, then run it!

The Discord PTB AppImage is built with [deb2appimage](https://github.com/simoniz0r/deb2appimage) using dependencies from Debian Jessie's repositories.  `libfreetype6` is also included for anyone stuck with a version of `libfreetype6` that gives nasty font rendering in Discord.

[Download AppImages from the releases page](https://github.com/simoniz0r/Discord-PTB-AppImage/releases)
